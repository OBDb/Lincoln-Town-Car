generations:
  - name: "First Generation (FN36/FN5)"
    start_year: 1981
    end_year: 1989
    description: "The original Lincoln Town Car debuted as a distinct model after previously serving as a trim package for the Continental. Based on Ford's Panther platform, it exemplified traditional American luxury with its formal upright styling, vinyl roof, and substantial chrome accents. Powered by a 5.0-liter V8 engine paired with a four-speed automatic transmission, it emphasized smooth, quiet operation over performance. The spacious interior featured plush bench seating for six passengers, wood-tone accents, and luxury amenities including power features, automatic climate control, and premium sound systems. The Town Car maintained classic rear-wheel-drive, body-on-frame construction when many competitors were transitioning to front-wheel-drive platforms. This generation established the Town Car as Lincoln's flagship sedan, appealing to traditional luxury buyers and fleet operators with its comfort, durability, and imposing presence. A significant refresh in 1985 brought more modern aerodynamic styling with flush-mounted headlights and a more rounded profile while maintaining its formal luxury character."

  - name: "Second Generation (FN36/FN5)"
    start_year: 1990
    end_year: 1997
    description: "The second-generation Town Car featured dramatically more aerodynamic styling with rounded edges, smoother surfacing, and a sloping trunk lid, though it maintained its formal luxury character with a chrome waterfall grille, stand-up hood ornament, and available vinyl roof treatments. Built on an updated version of the Panther platform, it continued with rear-wheel drive and body-on-frame construction. Initially powered by a 5.0-liter V8 (replaced by a more modern 4.6-liter V8 in 1991) producing 190-210 horsepower depending on the year, paired with a four-speed automatic transmission. The redesigned interior maintained its spacious six-passenger seating with front and rear bench seats, adding more modern controls, improved materials, and updated technology including available JBL audio systems, digital instrumentation, and keyless entry. Trim levels included Executive, Signature, and the top-level Cartier with exclusive features and badging. Safety advancements included standard driver and eventually passenger airbags, anti-lock brakes, and available traction control. This generation continued the Town Car's popularity with traditional luxury buyers, fleet services, and the livery industry, though it faced increasing competition from imported luxury sedans that offered more modern driving dynamics and technology."

  - name: "Third Generation (FN145)"
    start_year: 1998
    end_year: 2011
    description: "The final generation Town Car maintained its traditional full-size luxury formula while receiving more substantial updates to its styling, structure, and features. The exterior featured sharper edges, a more vertical grille design, and complex reflector headlights, with subtle styling refreshes in 2003 and 2008 to keep it current. Built on a revised Panther platform with significant structural improvements, it offered enhanced safety, better ride quality, and improved handling. Powered by a 4.6-liter V8 engine producing 200-239 horsepower depending on the year and specification, paired with a four-speed automatic transmission. The interior maintained its spacious six-passenger configuration while adding more modern appointments, improved materials, and updated technology. Available features included premium leather seating, Alpine or THX audio systems, heated seats, and dual-zone climate control. Trim levels evolved throughout this generation, with Signature and Ultimate series replacing the Executive/Signature/Cartier hierarchy in later years. The long-wheelbase L version, introduced in 2001, offered six additional inches of rear legroom specifically targeting the livery market. Despite decreasing retail sales as consumer preferences shifted toward SUVs and more modern luxury sedans, the Town Car maintained steady fleet sales until its discontinuation in 2011, ending a 30-year run as Lincoln's flagship traditional American luxury sedan. Throughout its final generation, the Town Car remained prized for its comfort, durability, and spaciousness, particularly in commercial applications."
